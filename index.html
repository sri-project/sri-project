		<h3>What is an Operating System?</h3>
		An operating system (OS) is the computer program that controls the base-level operation of a computer. It is the first thing loaded when a computer starts up, and it manages all of the activity and programs the computer uses. Every computer has one, but the size and sophistication of its capabilities do vary. You likely have had some exposure to them, although you may not realize it. Operating systems are in an integral part of a technological society such as ours. They are on your cell phones, tablets, and personal computers. Examples include; iOS, Android, Mac OS, Windows, and Linux.
		<br><br>
		<h3>What is a job?</h3>
		A job is a unit of work or task that an operating system performs based on some predefined order. You can think of them like the applications you execute on your computer. The email client, word processor, or web browser, you invoke to accomplish a personal activity. But they are much more than that. Jobs also handle things like printing, information transfer over the Internet, and running anti-virus software. In fact, everything you do on a computer is handled through a job of some sort. And their creation lets the operating system know that there is work to be done and that resources need to be allocated to that work.
		<br><br>
		<h3>Job Scheduling in an Operating System</h3>
		Job scheduling is the process of orchestrating the execution of the jobs a system needs to perform. Jobs are typically collected and ordered in some sort of queue, which we think of as being a first-in-first-out (FIFO) arrangement. But strictly speaking, this isn't true, as the order can be affected by a number of things. The most common are:
		<br>
		<ul>
			<li>Creation time that a job was assembled, and submitted for execution. On a personal computer, it might be when you clicked an icon to select an application you wish to use.</li>
			<li>Priority - not all jobs are created equal. For example, a device oriented job typically has a higher priority in the operating system than a print job. Why? Because device jobs happen asynchronously, and you don't want to lose any of them. As such, there is a priority assigned to these jobs, so they get executed first</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		<h3>What is Page in Operating System?</h3>
		A page, memory page, or virtual page is a fixed-length contiguous block of virtual memory, described by a single entry in the page table. It is the smallest unit of data for memory management in a virtual memory operating system. Similarly, a page frame is the smallest fixed-length contiguous block of physical memory into which memory pages are mapped by the operating system.
		<br><br>
		<h3>Page Fault</h3>
		When a program tries to reference a page not currently present in RAM, the processor treats this invalid memory reference as a page fault and transfers control from the program to the operating system. The operating system must:
		<br>
		<ul>
			<li>Determine the location of the data on disk.</li>
			<li>Obtain an empty page frame in RAM to use as a container for the data.</li>
			<li>Load the requested data into the available page frame.</li>
			<li>Update the page table to refer to the new page frame.</li>
			<li>Return control to the program, transparently retrying the instruction that caused the page fault.</li>
		</ul>
	
		When all page frames are in use, the operating system must select a page frame to reuse for the page the program now needs. If the evicted page frame was dynamically allocated by a program to hold data, or if a program modified it since it was read into RAM (in other words, if it has become "dirty"), it must be written out to disk before being freed. If a program later references the evicted page, another page fault occurs and the page must be read back into RAM.
		<br>
		The method the operating system uses to select the page frame to reuse, which is its page replacement algorithm, is important to efficiency. The operating system predicts the page frame least likely to be needed soon, often through the least recently used (LRU) algorithm or an algorithm based on the program's working set. To further increase responsiveness, paging systems may predict which pages will be needed soon, preemptively loading them into RAM before a program references them.
