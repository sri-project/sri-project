		<h4>Second-Chance Page Replacement</h4>
			
			A simple modification to FIFO that avoids the problem of throwing out a heavily
			used page is to inspect the R bit of the oldest page. If it is 0, the page is both
			old and unused, so it is replaced immediately. If the R bit is 1, the bit is cleared,
			the page is put onto the end of the list of pages, and its load time is updated as
			though it had just arrived in memory. Then the search continues.<br><br>
			
			The operation of this algorithm, called second chance, is shown below.
			In first figure we see pages A through H kept on a linked list and sorted by the
			time they arrived in memory.<br>

			Second figure shows Page list if a page fault occurs at time 20 and A has its R bit set. The numbers
			above the pages are their load times.<br><br>
			
			Suppose that a page fault occurs at time 20. The oldest page is A, which arrived
			at time 0, when the process started. If A has the R bit cleared, it is evicted from
			memory, either by being written to the disk (if it is dirty), or just abandoned (if it is
			clean). On the other hand, if the R bit is set, A is put onto the end of the list and its
			<b>load time</b> is reset to the current time (20). The R bit is also cleared. The search
			for a suitable page continues with B.<br>
			
			What second chance is looking for is an old page that has not been referenced
			in the most recent clock interval. If all the pages have been referenced, second
			chance degenerates into pure FIFO. Specifically, imagine that all the pages in
			first figure have their R bits set. One by one, the operating system moves the
			pages to the end of the list, clearing the R bit each time it appends a page to the end
			of the list. Eventually, it comes back to page A, which now has its R bit cleared. At
			this point A is evicted. Thus the algorithm always terminates.
